<h4>
    The phrase, farm to table, commonly referred to as farm to fork, has become a national movement in recent years that encourages<br> consumers to minimize the distance their food travels before itâ€™s eaten by buying food directly from growers. Though this practice isn't new, <br>its popularity has risen lately due to the growing concern over where our food comes from and how it's impacting local economies.<br> This concept, which has proved its staying power, encourages consumers to buy produce that is locally grown.
